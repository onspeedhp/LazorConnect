Before an app can interact with Backpack, it must first establish a connection. This connection request prompts the user to share their public key, signaling their consent to proceed. 

Once the user connects, Backpack provides a session parameter that should be used for all subsequent methods.

Please see Handling Sessions for more information on sessions.

Query String Parameters
app_url (required): A URL that provides app metadata (e.g., title, icon). It must be URL-encoded.

dapp_encryption_public_key (required): A public key for end-to-end encryption, used to generate a shared secret. Refer to the Encryption section for details on how Backpack manages shared secrets.

redirect_link (required): The URI where Backpack should redirect the user upon connection. See Specifying Redirects for more details. Must be URL-encoded.

cluster (optional): Specifies the network for subsequent interactions. To connect to Solana mainnet, leave the parameter unset or set it to mainnet-beta. To connect to Eclipse, set the parameter to solana:EAQLJCV2mh23BsK2P9oYpV5CHVLDNHTxY.

Returns
Approve
wallet_xxx: A base58-encoded encryption public key used by Backpack to build a shared secret between the connecting app and Backpack.

nonce: A nonce encoded in base58 that is used to encrypt the response.

data: JSON string that has been encrypted. Learn how apps can decrypt data using a shared secret in Encryption. Base58 is used to encode encrypted bytes.

}
public_key: The user's public key, represented as a base58-encoded string.

session: A string encoded in base58. This should be treated as opaque by the connecting app, as it only needs to be passed alongside other parameters. Sessions do not expire. For more information on sessions, please review Handling Sessions.

Reject
